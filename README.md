## 🎯 Problem

Operations teams must allocate scarce resources efficiently. This project tackles three classic OR problems using spreadsheet-based Solver models:

| Model | Business Question |
|---|---|
| **DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis)** | Which decision-making units (DMUs) are technically efficient, and what are the benchmarks for the inefficient ones? |
| **Linear Programming** | How should limited resources be allocated to maximise an objective (profit / output) subject to capacity, demand and supply constraints? |
| **Network Flow Optimisation** | What is the minimum-cost (or maximum-flow) routing through a supply-distribution network? |

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
- Input-oriented CRS/VRS models
- Efficiency frontier identification
- Benchmarking inefficient DMUs against peers
- Sensitivity to model orientation

### 2. Linear Programming (LP)
- Decision-variable formulation with objective function
- Constraint specification (capacity, demand, non-negativity)
- Solver configuration: **Simplex LP** method
- Shadow-price analysis and sensitivity reporting
- ±RHS / ±Objective coefficient ranges

### 3. Network Flow Optimisation
- Node-arc network representation
- Supply, demand and transhipment node modelling
- Minimum-cost flow / shortest-path formulation
- Solver-based solution with flow balance constraints

## 📈 Key Deliverables

- Solved Excel workbooks with Solver parameters pre-configured
- Sensitivity reports (Answer Report, Sensitivity Report, Limits Report)
- Interpretation of shadow prices and reduced costs
- Strategic recommendations based on optimisation results
